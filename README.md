Just a little C# library for my console based school applications.
Much of this code is useless because they are better ways to do it. But our teacher wants it that way.

## How to use it
1. Clone this repo
2. Build it in visual studio
3. Import the <code>bin/Debug/net6.0/Madu.dll</code> file in your project
